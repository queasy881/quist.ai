Step 1: Open Your Project Folder
Navigate to your project folder in File Explorer (where index.html, server.js, etc. are located)
Step 2: Open TWO Terminal Windows
Option A: Using VS Code (Recommended)

Open your project folder in VS Code
Open Terminal (View → Terminal or Ctrl + `)
Click the "+" button to open a second terminal

Option B: Using Command Prompt

Open two separate Command Prompt windows
In both, navigate to your project folder:

bash   cd C:\path\to\your\project

Step 3: Start Backend Server (Terminal 1)
In the first terminal, run:
bashnode server.js
```

✅ **You should see:**
```
Backend server running at http://localhost:3000
Ready! Open your chat page now.
⚠️ Keep this terminal running! Don't close it.

Step 4: Start Frontend Server (Terminal 2)
In the second terminal, run:
bashhttp-server
```

✅ **You should see:**
```
Starting up http-server
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.x.x:8080
```

⚠️ **Keep this terminal running too!** Don't close it.

---

### **Step 5: Open in Browser**

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080

🎯 Quick Checklist:

✅ Both terminals are running
✅ Backend shows "Backend server running at http://localhost:3000"
✅ Frontend shows "Available on: http://127.0.0.1:8080"
✅ Browser is open to http://localhost:8080
✅ Email verification modal appears


🔧 If You Get Errors:
"node: command not found"
Node.js isn't installed. Download from: https://nodejs.org/
"http-server: command not found"
Run this once:
bashnpm install -g http-server
"Port 3000 already in use"
Close the other terminal or app using port 3000, or change the port in server.js:
javascriptconst port = 3001; // Change from 3000 to 3001
Network Error in Browser
Make sure both terminals are running and showing the success messages.

📝 To Stop Everything:
Press Ctrl + C in both terminal windows.

💡 Pro Tip:
Create a file called start.bat (Windows) or start.sh (Mac/Linux) in your project folder:
Windows (start.bat):
batch@echo off
start cmd /k "node server.js"
start cmd /k "http-server"
echo Servers starting... Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
Then just double-click start.bat to start everything! 🚀
